## Installation Steps

You should use Eclipse to do the actual code editing, compiling, and deploying to the Robot.
#### Installing Eclipse

Windows and Mac users can download the latest Eclipse binary from the project website:
http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/

Linux users can download from their repositories
```
sudo apt-get install openjdk-7-jdk eclipse
```

Here are instructions provided by FIRST to using Eclipse for FRC.
[FRC Eclipse Plugin](http://firstforge.wpi.edu/sf/docman/do/downloadDocument/projects.wpilib/docman.root.c_and_java_documentation/doc1303/1)

Once you have Eclipse set up, point it to our team number, but otherwise there is no need to create a new project.
The project you will be working on is right here!

Code sharing will be handled by _git_ through _github_, which you see here.
