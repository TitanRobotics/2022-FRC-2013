## Installation Steps

You should use Eclipse to do the actual code editing, compiling, and deploying to the Robot.
#### Installing Eclipse

Windows and Mac users can download the latest Eclipse binary from the project website:
http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/

Linux users can download from their repositories
```
sudo apt-get install openjdk-7-jdk eclipse
```

Here are instructions provided by FIRST to using Eclipse for FRC.

Once you have Eclipse set up, point it to our team number, but otherwise there is no need to create a new project.
The project you will be working on is right here!

Code sharing will be handled by _git_ through _github_, which you see here.
